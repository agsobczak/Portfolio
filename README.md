# About me
I am a Junior QA Engineer soon with "automation" prefix. I am extremely motivated to constantly develop my skills and grow professionally. My objective is to excel in a challenging and innovative QA work environment.  I am looking for a company that will give me the chance to learn and develop myself as a Software tester.
